Successfully processed data using pandas and exported pivot results to csv.
Checked these with the sample data and get good correlation.
However, this is summary data for detailed i.e. city/peak/connection type.
Need to also produce summary for high level (all country, all city, etc. ).
todo find a way to produce all possible variations in panda.
