Successfully processed data using pandas and exported pivot results to csv.
Checked these with the sample data and get good correlation.
However, this is summary data for detailed i.e. city/peak/connection type.
Need to also produce summary for high level (all country, all city, etc. ).
todo find a way to produce all possible variations in panda.

Used pandas to generate pivot tables
Next step, finish data preparation by using hour to determine peak or off peak

Moved code for adding peak / city data to module
Next step add peak true/false

Using real data there is a correlation between my coded results for in city radius and source data.
Next step is to do the same for peak/ off peak

Added code to test if result is in city and tested with hard-coded data
Next step is to use real data
